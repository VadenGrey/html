    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello, my name is Mathieu Roberts, I am an aspiring software developer that just got out of the Army 2 months ago and was previously an apprentice machinist writing CNC. My main goal in becoming a software dev is to go the freelance route so I can only work when I feel like it even though I do thoroughly enjoy coding so far.</p>
