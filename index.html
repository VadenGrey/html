    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello, my name is Mathieu Roberts, I am an aspiring software developer that just got out of the Army 2 months ago and was previously an apprentice machinist writing CNC. My main goal in becoming a software dev is to go the freelance route so I can only work when I feel like it even though I do thoroughly enjoy coding so far.</p>
        <p>My Schooling</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Trade" highschool: I took a machining course while in highschool.</li>
                <li>Code Fellows(ongoing): I'm learning how to become a software developer.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>My job experience</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apprentice Machinist: For my first job I would help machine parts, measure said, and utilize CNC to make adjustments when necessary to the machining process</li>
                <li>Army: I was a Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic, which means I worked on anything that had wheels</li>
            </ul>
